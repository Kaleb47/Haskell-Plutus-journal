# Haskell-Plutus-journal

## Why Haskell?

The purpose of this journal is to learn how to write high-assurance smart contracts and document my progress with the team. Unlike, Solidity, which has only been around for 5 years, Haskell was invented in the late 80s so not only did it have more time to grow, but it has more capabilities than its imperative counterpart, solidity. As a functional programming language, there is no need to define every function in Haskell, because everything is a function, combine that with type inference from the compiler, that leaves less room for error. It may be a good idea to design a website using an imperative programming language, but when it comes to writing smart contracts that handle millions of dollars of cryptocurrencies, and people's identities, the consequences of failure are significantly higher. Its not a coincidence that Haskell is used by top tier investment banks, air-traffic controllers, and X-ray technicians; the margin of error is miniscule, otherwise people could die! A great example of the consequences of failure is the DAO hack of 2016

## Underlying reasons for developing on Cardano

Because I'm too busy to explain why we're developing on Cardano, watch these videos for your own education and amusement:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GupSfja8gMc - Eric Manganaro explains why the killer app of Haskell is plutus contracts.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HoH__7mLA1w - Hasan Michael giving a broad overview of the Cardano Blockchain.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d5ANRngQ_YE -  President of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, explains how unbanked countries will be the leading customer base for DeFi.

https://docs.plutus-community.com/ This is documetation on how to set up Plutus on your local environment. For Apple Silicon users, YOU MUST download Rosetta first and setup your dependencies in an Intel-based VS Code. The reason for this because IOHK does not have M1-compatible dependencies yet.
